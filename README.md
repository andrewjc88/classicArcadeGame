Hi there and welcome to my classic arcade game project.

It's somewhat sparse but I practiced a lot of object
oriented programming with this game.

To play simply use your arrow keys on your keyboard to move
the character to the other side of the screen without the
enemy bugs touching your character. You can also move from
right to left of the board to help win the game! Feel free
to reach out to me with any questions or concerns. The
settings are set to be pretty hard! Enjoy!
