# Andrew Cornell's  Classic Arcade Game Clone.

---
### Hi there and welcome to my classic arcade game project.

It's somewhat sparse but I practiced a lot of object oriented programming with this game.

---

## How To Play
1. Open index.html with web browser of choice.
2. Avoid colliding with enemy bugs.
3. Use arrow keys to maneuver character across screen to water.

 Thank you for looking and feel free to reach out to me via [Email](andrewjc88@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns. The settings are set to be pretty hard! Enjoy!

Best, regards <br>
Andrew Cornell

## To Do
---

+ Refactor render methods to one method with x, y, sprite and call method.
+ Create constant variables for Tile_width and tile height.
+ Implement collision detection as Enemy method instead of allEnemies array.
